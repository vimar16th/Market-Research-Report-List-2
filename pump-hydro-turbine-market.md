<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pump Hydro Turbine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-stage</li><li>Multi-stage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pump hydro turbines are used in energy storage systems to generate electricity. Single-stage pump hydro turbines have a single impeller and are mainly used for small-scale applications. They are simple and cost-effective but have limitations in terms of power output. On the other hand, multi-stage pump hydro turbines have multiple impellers stacked in series, providing higher power output suitable for large-scale applications. However, they are more complex and expensive to manufacture and maintain. Both types play a crucial role in enabling efficient energy storage and grid stabilization.</p></p>
