<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low Pressure Extruder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-screw Extruder</li><li>Twin-screw Extruder</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The low-pressure extruder market consists of two main types: single-screw extruders and twin-screw extruders. Single-screw extruders employ a single rotating screw to move and melt the material being extruded. They are commonly used for simpler applications that do not require precise control or mixing. On the other hand, twin-screw extruders utilize two intermeshing screws that provide better mixing and control over the extrusion process. They are preferred for applications that require greater processing flexibility, such as mixing different materials or adding additives.</p></p>
