<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radon Measurement Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Long Term Radon Test</li><li>Short Term Radon Test</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radon measurement devices are used to assess the presence and levels of radon, a radioactive gas, in residential and commercial buildings. Long-term radon tests utilize devices like alpha-track detectors, charcoal canisters, or electret ion chambers, and measure radon levels for 90 days or more, giving a more accurate average. Short-term radon tests, on the other hand, typically last anywhere from 2 days to 90 days and use devices such as charcoal canisters or continuous radon monitors, providing a snapshot of radon levels in a shorter timeframe.</p></p>
