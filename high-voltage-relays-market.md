<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Voltage Relays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact High Voltage Relays</li><li>No-Contact High Voltage Relays</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>High voltage relays are used in electrical systems to control and switch high voltage circuits. There are two main types of high voltage relays: contact high voltage relays and no-contact high voltage relays. Contact high voltage relays have physical contacts that make and break the circuit, providing a direct connection. On the other hand, no-contact high voltage relays use electronic or magnetic fields to open and close the circuit, without the need for physical contact. Both types serve the same purpose of controlling and switching high voltage circuits, but they employ different mechanisms to achieve it.</p></p>
