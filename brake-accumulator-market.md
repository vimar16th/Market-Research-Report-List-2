<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brake Accumulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inboard Brake Accumulator</li><li>Outboard Brake Accumulator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The brake accumulator market can be divided into two types: inboard brake accumulator and outboard brake accumulator. Inboard brake accumulators are installed inside the brake system, typically closer to the master cylinder. They store hydraulic pressure created by the master cylinder and help provide immediate braking power in case of a sudden loss of hydraulic pressure. On the other hand, outboard brake accumulators are placed outside the brake system, usually near the brake calipers. They serve to supply consistent pressure to the brakes, ensuring efficient stopping power.</p></p>
