<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cystoscope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid Cystoscope</li><li>Flexible Cystoscope</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cystoscope market comprises two main types: rigid cystoscopes and flexible cystoscopes. Rigid cystoscopes are traditional instruments that consist of a straight, fixed tube with an optical lens and light source. They are commonly used for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in urology and provide clear images but can be uncomfortable for patients. On the other hand, flexible cystoscopes are more modern devices that have a flexible tube, allowing for easier insertion and navigation within the urinary tract. They offer improved patient comfort but may provide slightly lower image quality compared to rigid cystoscopes.</p></p>
