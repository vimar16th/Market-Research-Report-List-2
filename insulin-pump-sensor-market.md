<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Insulin Pump Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Glucose Sensor</li><li>Non-Invasive Glucose Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The insulin pump sensor market includes two types of glucose sensors: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive glucose sensors require inserting a tiny needle under the skin to measure glucose levels in interstitial fluid. These sensors provide real-time data and are commonly used in insulin pumps. On the other hand, non-invasive glucose sensors measure blood glucose levels without the need for needle penetration. These sensors usually work by emitting light or using radio waves to gauge glucose levels through the skin, offering a less invasive option for monitoring glucose levels.</p></p>
