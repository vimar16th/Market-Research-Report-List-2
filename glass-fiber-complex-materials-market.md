<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glass Fiber Complex Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoset Composites</li><li>Thermoplastic Composites</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Glass Fiber Composite Materials refer to materials made by combining glass fibers with resin matrices. There are two main types: thermoset composites and thermoplastic composites. Thermoset composites are formed by a chemical reaction that irreversibly hardens the material, making it rigid and durable. On the other hand, thermoplastic composites can be reheated and reshaped multiple times without losing their properties, offering more flexibility in manufacturing. Both types of composites have various applications, such as in aerospace, automotive, construction, and consumer goods industries.</p></p>
