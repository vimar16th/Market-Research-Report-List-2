<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brewster Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uncoated</li><li>Coated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Brewster plates are used to control the polarization of light. There are two types available in the market: uncoated and coated. Uncoated Brewster plates are made of a single material and provide a fixed polarization state for light passing through them. Coated Brewster plates, on the other hand, have an additional layer that alters the polarization state of light. This allows for adjustable control over the polarization, making them more versatile than uncoated plates. Both types are widely used in various applications, including optics, telecommunications, and spectroscopy.</p></p>
