It is used as a smoking cessation aid to help individuals quit smoking by reducing their cravings and withdrawal symptoms. When chewing the gum, nicotine is released and absorbed into the bloodstream through the lining of the mouth.</p><p>The nicotine gum market has been witnessing steady growth over the years. The increasing awareness about the harmful effects of smoking and the rising number of initiatives by governments and healthcare organizations to encourage smoking cessation are major factors contributing to the market growth. Moreover, the availability of nicotine gum over-the-counter without a prescription has made it a convenient and popular choice among individuals looking to quit smoking.</p><p>In recent years, there have been various trends observed in the nicotine gum market. One such trend is the introduction of flavored nicotine gums that aim to make the quitting process more enjoyable.

According to the forecast, the market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.4% during the forecast period. The increasing prevalence of smoking and the rising number of smokers looking for effective smoking cessation aids are the key driving factors behind this growth.
