<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Rakes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Rotor Rotary Rakes</li><li>Multi-Rotor Rotary Rakes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary rakes are agricultural machines used for raking hay or other crops into windrows for drying or baling. There are two main types of rotary rakes: single rotor rotary rakes and multi-rotor rotary rakes. </p><p>Single rotor rotary rakes have only one rotor which rotates and picks up the crop, transferring it to the center of the machine to form a windrow. They are generally smaller in size and suitable for small to medium-sized fields.</p><p>On the other hand, multi-rotor rotary rakes consist of multiple rotors that work simultaneously to gather the crop and form wider windrows. These rakes are typically larger in size and are more efficient for larger fields or operations that require increased productivity.</p><p>Both types of rotary rakes are designed to improve the efficiency of haymaking by reducing manual labor and increasing the speed of hay drying.</p></p>
