<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flue Gas Desulfurizer (FGD) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Flue Gas Desulfurizer</li><li>Semi-Dry Flue Gas Desulfurizer</li><li>Wet Flue Gas Desulfurizer</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Flue Gas Desulfurizer (FGD) is a technology used to remove sulfur dioxide (SO2) from flue gas emissions in power plants and industrial processes. There are three types of FGD markets: dry, semi-dry, and wet. Dry FGD uses a dry sorbent to absorb and neutralize SO2. Semi-dry FGD involves spraying a slurry-like sorbent onto the flue gas, removing SO2 with the help of an absorber. Wet FGD uses a liquid such as limestone slurry to scrub and absorb the SO2. These technologies help reduce sulfur emissions and minimize environmental impact.</p></p>
