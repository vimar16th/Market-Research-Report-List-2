<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suspension Magnet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Cleaning</li><li>Self Cleaning</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Suspension magnets are used in industries to remove ferrous contaminants from materials such as coal, minerals, and metals. There are two types of suspension magnets in the market: manual cleaning and self-cleaning. </p><p>Manual cleaning suspension magnets require workers to manually clean the magnet, removing the collected contaminants periodically. This type is suitable for industries with lower contamination levels.</p><p>On the other hand, self-cleaning suspension magnets are equipped with systems that automatically remove the contaminants from the magnet. This type is more suitable for industries with higher contamination levels and requires less human intervention and maintenance.</p></p>
