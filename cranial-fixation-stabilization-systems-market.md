<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cranial Fixation & Stabilization Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resorbable Fixation Systems</li><li>Nonresorbable Fixation Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cranial fixation and stabilization systems are used in neurosurgical procedures to secure bone fragments in the skull. Resorbable fixation systems are made of materials that can be gradually absorbed by the body over time, eliminating the need for removal surgery. Nonresorbable fixation systems, on the other hand, are made of permanent materials and may require a separate removal procedure. Both types are used to provide stability and support during the healing process of skull fractures or after neurosurgical interventions.</p></p>
