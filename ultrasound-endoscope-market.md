<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrasound Endoscope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soft Endoscope</li><li>Rigid Endoscope</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ultrasound endoscope market can be categorized into two types: soft endoscopes and rigid endoscopes. Soft endoscopes are flexible instruments fitted with small cameras that are used to examine internal body organs and tissues. They are highly maneuverable and can navigate through narrow passages. On the other hand, rigid endoscopes are inflexible and have fixed angles, making them suitable for examining larger body cavities or hollow organs. Both types of endoscopes utilize ultrasound technology to produce detailed imaging for medical diagnosis and treatment.</p></p>
