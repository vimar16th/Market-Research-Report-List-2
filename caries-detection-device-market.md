<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Caries Detection Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fluorescent Technology</li><li>Transillumination Technology</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Caries Detection Device market consists of two main types: fluorescent technology and transillumination technology. Fluorescent technology involves the use of a fluorescent dye that highlights caries or decayed areas when illuminated with a specific wavelength of light. Transillumination technology, on the other hand, uses a light source placed behind the tooth to detect caries by examining the differences in light transmission through healthy and decayed regions. Both technologies aid dentists in identifying caries at early stages and enable prompt treatment.</p></p>
