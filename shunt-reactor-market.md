<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shunt Reactor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil-Immersed</li><li>Air-Core</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The shunt reactor market can be categorized into two main types: oil-immersed and air-core. Oil-immersed shunt reactors are filled with insulating oil to enhance their performance and provide better cooling. They are typically used in high voltage transmission systems. On the other hand, air-core shunt reactors do not contain any insulating oil, instead they rely on the air for cooling. These reactors are suitable for lower voltage applications such as distribution systems. Both types play a crucial role in regulating voltage levels and improving power system stability.</p></p>
