<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Deformable Mirror Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Segmented Mirrors</li><li>Continuous Surface Mirrors</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The deformable mirror market consists of two types: segmented mirrors and continuous surface mirrors. Segmented mirrors are composed of small individual mirrors that can be adjusted independently to correct distortions in the incoming light wavefront. These mirrors are suitable for applications requiring high precision, such as astronomical telescopes. Continuous surface mirrors, on the other hand, have a smooth and uninterrupted reflective surface that can be deformed as a whole to correct wavefront imperfections. They are commonly used in adaptive optics systems for laser beam shaping or microscopy.</p></p>
