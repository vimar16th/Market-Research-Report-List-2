<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial X-Ray Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Conversion</li><li>Indirect Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Industrial X-Ray Flat Panel Detector market encompasses two main types: Direct Conversion and Indirect Conversion detectors. Direct Conversion detectors directly convert X-ray photons into electrical charges, providing high-resolution images and eliminating the need for scintillators. Indirect Conversion detectors use scintillators to convert X-ray photons into visible light, which is then converted into electrical signals. While Direct Conversion offers better image quality and efficiency, Indirect Conversion detectors are more cost-effective and widely adopted. Both types play a crucial role in industrial applications by providing accurate and detailed X-ray imaging for defect detection and quality control purposes.</p></p>
