<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Biliary Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Covered Metal Biliary Stent</li><li>Uncovered Metal Biliary Stent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Metal Biliary Stent market offers two main types: Covered Metal Biliary Stent and Uncovered Metal Biliary Stent. Covered Metal Biliary Stents are stents with an outer covering that helps prevent the stent from migrating and causing complications. The covering also reduces the risk of tissue ingrowth, which can lead to blockage. On the other hand, Uncovered Metal Biliary Stents lack an outer covering, allowing tissue ingrowth and potentially causing blockage. Selection between the two types depends on the specific requirements of the patient and the procedure being performed.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Metal Biliary Stent Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Benign Biliary Strictures</li><li>Malignant Biliary Obstruction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Metal biliary stents are widely used in the treatment of benign biliary strictures and malignant biliary obstructions. In cases of benign biliary strictures, the stents are employed to open up narrowed or blocked bile ducts, allowing for the normal flow of bile. Similarly, in situations of malignant biliary obstruction, the stents serve to relieve the blockage caused by tumors or cancerous growths, promoting the smooth passage of bile and relieving associated symptoms. These stents play a crucial role in alleviating complications and improving the quality of life for affected patients.</p></p>
